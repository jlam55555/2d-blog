I was playing around with Google Chrome themes and extensions recently. Here's
what I've come up with in the last day:



 * Dark Theme [downloads/DarkTheme.crx]: A minimalist, black and dark-grey
   theme.
 * Chat Newtab Replacement [downloads/ChatExtension.crx]: I've modified my Chat
   application to be a Chrome extension. It's also improved in that you cannot
   post before it has connected with the server.
 * UPDATE: Chat Popup [downloads/ChatPopup.crx]: Perhaps a more useful version
   of the newtab extension, this shows a popup once you click the extension
   button in the top-right of Chrome. Having to sign-in every time is a bit
   tedious, however.



To install either of these extensions (a theme is a special type of extension),
you have to drag and drop the .crx file into the chrome://extensions page. You
can't see my mouse in the screenshot above, but it shows the general idea. Allow
it to be added to Chrome.

If I had five bucks, I would add it to the Chrome Web Store
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/], but I don't and I'm too lazy. Therefore,
your administrator might block the extensions because they are unofficial (as my
school one did).

(And if you can't do the above because you don't have Chrome, get it
[https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html])!
