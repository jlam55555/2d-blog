Bump.

That's how they do it, right? Revive a blog post? Spark some interest into a
community driven by the present? A present that is always burying the past? The
past that is full of virtuous mistakes and the subsequent lessons?

And that's what I hope to do. Revive this blog. I felt that it was very
necessary for me, months ago in Semester one of this year, when I was not doing
so well in English class. And then I did well in English class, first quarter of
semester two. The problem is, fourth quarter is coming, and I feel that I'm
slacking.

I need practice. Serious practice. And that's where this blog comes into play.

So welcome back into my life! I really hope no one is reading this right now,
because I'm talking to my blog— an inanimate, digital entity. Oh well. I've done
it before, and I'm sure to do it again.

On a side note, I am hoping to revive not only my English language skills, but
also those of my secondary, student languages: Spanish (espaÃ±ol) and Chinese
(ä¸­æ–‡). I was thinking to include some in each post, at least a relevant
sentence or two.

pinyin-to-Chinese converter [http://www.purpleculture.net/online-chinese-input/]
for my Chinese input.
