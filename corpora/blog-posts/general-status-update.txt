Coding



 * I've got another one. Based off of Jacob Wunder [http://jacobwunder.com/]'s
   Tap Tap Pop! [http://jacobwunder.com/tap-tap-pop/] (which was based off of
   Pop the Lock
   [http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2015/10/02/simple-machine-brings-pop-the-lock-to-android/]),
   here [extras/PopTheLock] is my own version of Pop the Lock. It's arguably
   very simple, minimalistic, and feature-less— but it captures the main essence
   of the game1.
 * I'm getting along farther with Project Euler [https://projecteuler.net/] now.
   I've completed 62 problems (up to question 97), and they are really a fun
   challenge in the world of the dull challenges of school. Feel free to check
   out my solutions at my Euler page [extras/Euler].
 * The new programming club at Barlow2 is moving along smoothly. Many of the
   others are learning game development, especially through JS and its
   libraries. I've worked on a fun little website
   [http://barlowprogramming.github.io/] with it, which uses many new
   technologies. I've worked with others (essentially) for the first time, and
   learned some more of the GitHub workflow. I've even got some people to try
   Project Euler with me! Us nerds are busy learning and coding. Cheers!

School





 * Ah, school. I'm finally beginning to get into the swing of things in this
   crazy second semester. A quarter has just passed, many assessments finished,
   and now I can clean out much of my binder.
 * Sophomore speakouts are coming up soon! I really need to organize myself and
   strengthen my topic. As I've mentioned earlier
   [http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=66], I'll try to use these
   blog posts as thinking on paper.

Extracurriculars



 * School bowling season has finished. I need to find new recruits for my
   captain-hood next year. Regular bowling is as normal.
 * Track season has started! I'm injured. ☹
 * I've had quite an interesting experience with piano. I played terribly at the
   YMF, completely starting over because of a memory error. I somehow managed to
   get a (full) 5 score on it, however. Today, with the same piece, I managed to
   tie for first in a Chopin competition. I was not expecting it, and now I have
   to play it again next week. I'm not enthused. That means another week of hard
   practice, another week of stressing out, another week of time management
   battles, another week of multiple piano lessons. But on the upside, it means
   $50 in prize money3!

1: I believe, as I have not not played the original game.

2: Check out our GitHub [https://github.com/BarlowProgramming/].

3: It is not actually that much considering that the entry fee was $45.
