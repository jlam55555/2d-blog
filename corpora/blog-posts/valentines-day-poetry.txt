> "Chinese Love": I guess my parents told them we drink a lot of milk at home.
> They didn't drink milk, and didn't have any at their house. So the first day
> at work, her husband dragged me to the grocery store next to her store and
> ordered me to get a milk carton. I couldn't refuseâ€” physically. So we got a
> half-gallon of Lactaid milk (there was no regular alternative) and left. We
> did not get close to finishing the half-gallon by the time we left their house
> a week later.
