Because of the increasing complexity of the site, I've decided to create a quick
little list of my projects in the "About" section of the page. Just click there
and you'll see links to all of the projects I've posted to. The yellow links are
for programming webpages, the orange links are for publications, and the red
links are for downloadable content.

It's a simple, dynamic feature to benefit the organization of the site.
