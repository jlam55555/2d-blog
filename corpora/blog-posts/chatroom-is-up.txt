The result of my preliminary experimentation
[http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=27] with Node.js and Socket.io
has resulted in an interesting, real-time chat application!

You can visit it either at lam-node-test.herokuapp.com
[https://lam-node-test.herokuapp.com] where it's hosted on Heroku
[https://www.heroku.com/] or here at TheHomeworkLife
[http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/extras/Chat]. They both push messages towards
the same server, so if you see messages on either application, it'll show up on
both! It's still in real-time, and now uses FontAwesome icons that I was
experimenting with before [http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=25].

Note that there may be a few-second delay (a warming-up of the Node.js server)
when first visiting the site for the first time. This is the result of my free
hosting. It should start quickly in subsequent runs.
