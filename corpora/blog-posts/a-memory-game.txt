For fun and for skill, I've created a classic memory game [extras/MemoryGame].
It uses HTML (the content), JavaScript (the logic) and CSS (the style). The
jQuery [https://jquery.com/] (a JavaScript library) helped make it look nice as
well. I played around a lot with CSS animations
[http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp] to make the transitions look
nice.
