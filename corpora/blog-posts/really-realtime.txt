I was experimenting around with Node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/], a powerful
JavaScript library that I had little understanding of. This was because I had
heard it had certain websocket [http://www.websocket.org/] back-end capabilities
that I had wanted for real-time data updates. In this, the server (the back-end)
can send data back to the client (the front-end, or browser), which is a
powerful tool that I've never encountered.

So I played around with it a little bit, and I eventually made a little
real-time chat program with Socket.io [http://socket.io/], which builds a
websocket server-side. See my demo at Realtime Chatting
[https://lam-node-test.herokuapp.com/].
