Sorry, I will (probably) not be posting for the next few days out of a major
restructuring of the post storage for bandwidth (speed) improvements. (More
specifically, I am trying to reduce the number of posts that are downloaded to
the number that you need.) Iâ€™ll try to have junior blogger Juliet post in my
stead.

Sorry! (Yes, Iâ€™ll pretend there are readers out there …)
