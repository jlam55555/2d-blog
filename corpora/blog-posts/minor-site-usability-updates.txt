I know I just said that I wouldn't be making updates to the site, but it's a
Saturday and I have time. There were a few minor details I wanted to fix to
improve the site, like always. Here's an overview:

 * FontAwesome Icons I've replaced some of the minor images to FontAwesome icons
   [https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/]. As I've mentioned earlier,
   it's pretty amazing [http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=25]:
   it's clean, it's versatile, and it acts like dynamic, style-able regular
   text.
 * Improved Post Listing I've added the date and author of the posts for clarity
   in the About section.
 * Fixed Dark Gradients In Safari (for iOS), the gradients from transparent to
   white were too dark. This has been fixed.
 * Stopped Syntax Highlighting I felt that the extra time spent loading the
   scripts for syntax highlighting were unnecessary, even despite its
   awesomeness. I figured you all don't care about code that much anyways. In
   addition, there haven't been many posts with code (only two)â€” the code will
   still be formatted with indenting monospaced text, but it will not be colored
   anymore.



Also, this is the fiftieth post! I'm surprised I survived this far!
