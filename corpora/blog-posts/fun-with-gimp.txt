GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) [https://www.gimp.org/] is a wonderful
free image editing program. It comes default for some versions of Ubuntu and is
a great free alternative to other powerful ones out there.

I'd only been using it for very simple image editing (If I was away, I would use
Autodesk Pixlr [https://pixlr.com/editor/], a wonderful in-browser, also-free
alternative.), but today I decided to check out their tutorials page
[http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/].

So far I'd only tried out the first two tutorials, but it's great fun!
