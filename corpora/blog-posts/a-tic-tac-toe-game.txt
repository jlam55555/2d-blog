I thought the previous memory game [extras/MemoryGame] was pretty fun to make
and play, so I thought I'd make another one, perhaps with the same color scheme
and a similar feel. And so I did!

Introducing the Tic Tac Toe [extras/TicTacToe] game for TheHomeworkLife. It has
pretty good logic and is actually difficult to beat (especially if it starts in
the middle)! Have fun with it!
