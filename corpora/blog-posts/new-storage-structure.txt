The Homework Life has switched over to a (MariaDB) database for storage! Now
posts will be more secure and faster to load.

We have switched from the JSON format (much easier to set up but harder to
maintain, especially as data gets BIG) to a relational database. Now, after some
tedious setup, the site will load quicker on any load, without having to load
every single post as it had to before. With the JSON file that had to be loaded
quickly approaching 50 kilobytes in size, this started to get ideal â€¦ why not
just query a database for the little information you're actually looking for?

It's still a little experimental, so let's see how this turns out!
