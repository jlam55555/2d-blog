The title says it all. It's an dialogue inspired by Othello
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello] (the play by Shakespeare) and a
synthesis paper [https://www.msu.edu/~jdowell/135/Synthesis.html].
Unfortunately, it's also a rough draft, but I'm working on that. And lastly,
it's my first literary-work-for-school publication on this site.

Because it's a synthesis paper, it draws upon multiple sources. Therefore, it's
a spoiler if you've read any one of those books. Spoiler alerts for the
following: Lord of the Flies [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies]
by William Golding, Fahrenheit 451
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451] by Ray Bradbury, Ella Minnow Pea
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Minnow_Pea] by Mark Dunn, and Othello. If
you haven't read them, they're highly recommended thought-provoking novels!

To get a good sense of it, the thesis (yes, a dialogue can convey a meaning,
too!) goes as follows:

> When a mindless person falls prey to haste, it acts as a magnifying vessel to
> other destructive forces such as jealousy; however, when that selfsame haste
> be applied to a person who carefully accounts for their own actions and
> thoughts, then it provides a boosterish rush towards accomplishment.Jonathan

Right now, it's a bit wordy and not as well-developed in thought as I would like
it to be, but it's a start. Now it's time to start freaking about about midterms
(this week) again!

Again, I don't know if this blog will ever be recognized or useful, but for now
it's simply a way for myself to reference my own thoughts. Just for now.
