I feel so lucky right now. I've been able to experience the first true
programming language, Assembly, and feel somewhat good about attempting to
understand it in one day.

I've attempted this once, a few years ago, but simply deemed it too difficult
and non-essential. But why would it be to blame when it was the precedent for
many other languages today?

I started with the TutorialsPoint tutorial
[http://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/] on it, and it has been
rather helpful.

I began the tutorial during school today. We had "SpringFest," a school day with
two hours dedicated to "fun" hours and activities. For others, this meant
playing Frisbee, eating ice cream, playing video games; for me, it meant getting
as much homework done as possible to lighten my load for this weekend. Because I
really need this Speakout done.

And finally, it's under five minutes and almost fits all of the
content-requirements! It's a wonderful sight to see.

So, all positive things so far, but I believe it will be difficult squeezing in
these two time-consuming activities this weekend. I guess I'll have to hold back
on the coding a bit until after the Speakout is done and rehearsed. Oh well.

And to top that off, I have a "diagnostic" SAT/ACT preparation test tomorrow,
the first of my path of standardized test prep.

Oops, I've gone overtime already! See you tomorrow!
