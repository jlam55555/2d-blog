I made a few quick changes to improve the overall display of the website.

First of all, the date will not change if I edit a post. Therefore, the posts
will appear in chronological order, and this will avoid confusion when I do edit
a post. I will indicate when I update a post directly in the update instead. (I
will update the previous update on updating posts to make sure that this will
work).

Secondly, all <a> (link), <em> (italics), and <strong> (bold) tags appear inline
and with their parent's font-size and color. This will avoid some
inconsistencies in the font that appeared earlier. Long links also were
problematic in the mobile version, and this will fix that as well.

Also, as a precaution, I will be backing up the site posts. It won't affect you,
but it's for my peace-of-mind.
