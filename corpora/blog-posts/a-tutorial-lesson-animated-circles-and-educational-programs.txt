I worked with the new Programming Club after school today. An alumni worked us
through a simple webpage themed like his webpage [http://www.hunterlightman.com]
that used jQuery to position and animate. It was quite interesting, and I
learned a simple, mathematical way to animate items in circles basic with
trigonometry. You can see my tweaked result at Planetary [extras/Planetary]. I'm
very excited for future projects like this, especially when I can pick up a tip
or two on algorithms such as the circle one.

Other Updates:

 * I also created a program based on the need to balance chemical equations
   [http://www.chemteam.info/Equations/Balance-Equation.html]. You can see this
   at Balencistry [extras/Balencistry]. It allows you to visually see the
   comparison of different elements on both sides with a double bar graph.
 * In the same spirit of school topics, I've also uploaded Periodic Letters
   [extras/PeriodicLetters], a tool for a project earlier this year. We were
   consolidating our knowledge on the structure of the periodic table, and our
   quarter project was to make a popular phrase using just periodic elements.
   I've also included "Jelementium" (J) and "Unoctquadium" (Uoq) in order to get
   all of the missing elements. I didn't focus much on printing, so long words
   are discouraged.
 * And lastly, I changed the URLS of the single-page project pages (namely,
   Memory Game [extras/MemoryGame] and Tic Tac Toe [extras/TicTacToe]) to
   directories instead of individual files. All the links on this site have been
   updated.
