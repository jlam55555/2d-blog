A new favicon (the icon next to the title in the tab bar), a new logo (which I
made), a new web-application for iOS â€¦ thehomeworklife has underwent major
graphical changes today!

To activate the web-application, open Safari on your mobile device, and click
the "Share" button as you see in the image on the right. Then, scroll right on
the bottom row and click on "Add to Home Screen." This should add an app-like
icon to your home screen, and it should look like a regular, standalone app when
you open it.

As of now, the mobile version is very buggy, especially with the small screen
size of the iPhone, but I'll try to improve it soon. For now, enjoy!
