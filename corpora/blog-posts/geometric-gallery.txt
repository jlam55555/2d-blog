Here are three more SVGs I have created.

 1. (top) An SVG version of the The Homework Life logo â€” drawn again from
    scratch
 2. (below, left) A low-poly-art cat image (from Google Images
    [https://www.petfinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/140272627-grooming-needs-senior-cat-632x475.jpg])
 3. (below, right) A low-poly-art Exploding Kittens
    [http://www.explodingkittens.com/] box image (from my own image, but I
    accidentally deleted the original)
