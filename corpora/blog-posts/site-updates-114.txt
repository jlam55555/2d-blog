There's been so many changes to the site (version 1.1.0) in the last few days!
Here's a brief overview of them.


External (Visual) Changes

 * Added FontAwesome [http://fontawesome.io/] icons
 * Improved title-text descriptions (one for every link)
 * Sort posts in post list and search list
 * Added social media buttons
 * Added random quote generator (see bottom of page!)
 * Added search hint
 * Revamped sidebar on desktop (much cleaner!)
 * Added search bar to sidebar on desktop
 * Revamped index.html [/index.html] page (much more informative!)


Internal Changes

 * Added post tags
 * Added searching by post tags
 * Added RSS feed
 * Cleaned up CSS
 * More robust RWD with .mobile and .desktop CSS classes
 * Less data sent to webpages (faster load time)
 * Internal dates set to RFC 2822 standard*

(* Because all of the dates were previously only dates, all of the times for
posts prior to this one will either be set to 12:00AM or 1:00AM, for sorting
reasons. Posts after this one should have correct times set.)

That's basically all I had in mind for a working blog. These are the end of the
major updates for version 1 of this blog.

Happy reading!
